Optional video tutorial for installing SuperBLT, BeardLib, and mod_overrides mods: https://youtu.be/rin_sjSJIkg

1. After downloading the mod, use a program such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) to extract the main folder of the mod.
2. Navigate to `assets/mod_overrides`. The assets folder is supposed to be in your game's installation folder (don't know where that is? click [here](https://wiki.modworkshop.net/books/installing-payday-2-mods/page/finding-payday-2s-install-folder) ). Create the folder if necessary
3. Move the main folder of the mod from step 1 to the folder you navigated to in step 2.
